# Duck Mode README

Duck Mode allows your VS Code sessions to be way more
duck flavoured than a default installation. This not only
increases the quality of your codebase, but also makes
rich people throw their money at you, and also people who
you are attracted to may take notice.

## Features

- Duck icons. Everywhere.
- Duck sounds.
- AI integration. We don't know what AI is, but we integrated it.

## Requirements

Don't be a jerk. Eat your vegetables. Wash a little more.

## Known Issues

We're not sure of the sort of ducks we support. There are
166 species of duck according to a poorly thought out Google
search. It's probably one of them.

## Release Notes

These release notes assume we'll release more than one version.
We will probably never be that drunk again.

### 0.2.0 - Dan's Harem release. In honour of, well, we're not exactly sure what.

### 0.1.0 - Arko memorial release. Taken from us too soon.

Added some icons or something? Probably more ducks, I dunno, it
was a while between the code and this sentence.

### 0.0.2

Knuckled down hard and committed to keeping it appalling.

### 0.0.1

Woke up in the cold light of day, and realised what we had done.

Initial release of duck mode. Damn. you really read this far?
