# Duck Mode README

Duck Mode allows your VS Code sessions to be way more
duck flavoured than a default installation. This not only
increases the quality of your codebase, but also makes
rich people throw their money at you, and also people who
you are attracted to may take notice.

## Features

- Duck icons. Everywhere.

## Requirements

Don't be a jerk. Eat your vegetables. Wash a little more.

## Known Issues

We're not sure of the sort of ducks we support. There are
166 species of duck according to a poorly thought out Google
search. It's probably one of them.

## Release Notes

These release notes assume we'll release more than one version.
We will probably never be that drunk again.

### 0.0.0

Initial release of duck mode. Damn. you really read this far?
