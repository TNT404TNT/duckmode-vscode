 * Seriously? You're looking at this code on GitHub?
 * 
 * Let's have a good, honest, open talk about your problem.
 * It's definitely a problem, and believe me, your case is
 * bordering on a sort of OCD. I think it's time some close
 * friends staged an intervention before you become too
 * dehydrated.
 * 
 * So, you'll find no code in here to do what you're thinking
 * it does. We keep that to ourselves. We have have own problems.
